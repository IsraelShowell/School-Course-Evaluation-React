# Project: School-Course-Evaluation System React

# Version: 0.1.0

# Description:

This is a web application where a user can register an account with a username and password, login into their account, and make an evaluation on a course.
An admin can login and view completed evaluations submitted by users.
This web application uses SQLite/SQLAlchemy as its database system, a React Front-End, and Python as its Back-End. <br>
This web application is a way for me to practice using Github Actions, Flask development, linking a React Front-End to Python Back-End, creating a practical program,
reusing old software, and database management actions including, but not limited to;

- Python Development
- Flask Development
- REST APIs
- Github Actions
- Database documentation
- Accessing databases
- Creating tables inside databases
- Inserting data into the tables
- Checking the contents of tables
- Connecting Front-Ends and Back-Ends together
- Developing Web Applications
- Software Reuse; Primarily Component and Unit reuse

ChatGPT, and other online resources were NOT extensively used to develop this code, they were mostly used to explain documentation and explain errors! <br>
